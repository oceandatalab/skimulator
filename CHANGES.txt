parameter file

2.3
---
2018/12/14

- Fix typos

2.1
---
2018/10/17
- Handle any OGCM file withou waves (no noise is produced)

- Add rms diagnostics for L2c

- Add first time of model in parameter file to handle timestamps in netcdf
 files

- Add interpolation of model during regridding of L2c for diagnostic purposes

 reconstruction)

2.0
---
2018/10/16
- Handle interpolation of an ensemble of variables and files provided in the
 parameter file

- Compute sigma and G from mss, wind, stockes ..., compute instrumental noise
 from sigma0 and wave bias from stockes and G

- Compute remaining wave bias with simulating a correction using neighbors
 (errdcos function)

- Clean up by splitting codes and creation of new module mod_run

- Add module in test for diagnostics puposes (RMS for L2b and L2c )

- Add 2018 new configurations (2018_8a, b, c and 2018_6a)

- Correct satellite elevation used for Metop

- Fix bug in L2c during interpolation of descending tracks

1.31
---
2018/09/18
- Remove attenuation in sin(beam_angle) assuming that we will be able to
 correct it

1.3
---
2018/07/18
- Add attenuation in sin(beam_angle) in projected radial velocity

1.2
---
2018/07/01
- Handle generation of grid only when no model file is provided

- Implement error messages and user proof simulator

- Handle files with Arakawa grid C.

- Fix bugs (sorting index in multiprocessor to handle files in the right order,
 interpolation in global simulation, add errors to model, angle to compute
 instrumental rms)
